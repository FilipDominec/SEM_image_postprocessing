# SIMPLE PREPROCESSING
pixel_anisotropy        = 0.91      ## Set to <1 to compensate raw images being too wide
subtract_min_brightness = True      ## If set, compensates for wrong zero-signal value of photomultiplier
retouch_databar         = True      ## Full-white, thin-printed databar can be easily identified and retouched

# SETTINGS FOR ALIGNMENT OF CATHODOLUMINESCENCE IMAGES
disable_transform       = False     ## if set to true, the images will just be put atop of each other (no shift, no affine tr.)
use_affine_transform    = False     ## enables scaling, tilting and rotating the images; otherwise they are just shifted
consecutive_alignment   = True      ## if disabled, images are aligned always to the first one
decim                   = 2         ## decimation of images prior to correlation (value of 2-5 speeds up processing, but does not affect the results much)

# FINE TUNING OF ALIGNMENT PROCEDURE
#databar_pct            = 0.12      ## relative height of databar at the images' bottom - these must be ignored when searching for correlation
databar_pct             = 0.01      ##     (set near zero when no databar present, or when it can be retouched)
detect_edges            = False     ## if enabled, Laplace operator is applied before image matching
rel_max_shift           =  .15      ## relative border cropped, limits the maximum shift when fitting (higher number results in slower computation)
trmatrix_factor         = 1.0       ## tuning parameter, theoretically this should be 1.0; 
rel_smoothing           = 2e-3      ## for noisy images, increasing to 0.01 (i.e. 1% of image width) may be useful
force_downsample        = False     ## for images that are blurry and/or noisy so that halving resolution does not reduce information

# FILE HANDLING
extra_img_ident         = 'S'       ## each image containing this in its name is treated as extra  ## TODO identify extra by analyzing headers!
extra_img_label         = '+'       ## each image name preceded by this is treated as extra (and this symbol is removed prior to loading)
param_in_filename       = u'Î»(nm)'  ## if filenames differ in some number, this is the physical quantity that differs

# IMAGE POST-PROCESSING SETTINGS:
green_channel_factor    = 0.6       ## Use 0.8 for perceptively flat brightness; use e.g. 0.4 for narrow-band spectral emission
mean_brightness_norm    = 0.5		## If set to 1, image is normalized to mean brightness. Can be fractional.
max_brightness_norm     = 0.5		## If set to 1, image is normalized to maximum. Can be fractional, can combine with mean_brightness_norm.
saturation_enhance      =  .15      ## How much is the monochromated image subtracted from the output image
unsharp_weight          = 0.0       ## Unsharp mask to slightly deblur images
unsharp_radius          = 6.0       ##    (pixels)
gamma					= 1.5		## Set to 1.0 for linear color scale; set to e.g. 1.5 to enhance brightness in shadows
